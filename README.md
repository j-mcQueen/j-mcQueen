## Profile

Hello, my name is Jack McQueen - welcome to my Github! My educational background is in Chemistry with Drug Discovery, but when I discovered the world of web development, I adored how it blended creative expression and problem solving together, and decided to pursue the dream of getting into the industry.

Being entirely self-taught, my journey began with HTML, CSS, and JS. I developed my programming experience in a voluntary position, where I learned PHP, SQL, and MySQL, and built a front-end for a commercial cleaning company. Currently, I have been rather enthusiastic about learning React, the PERN stack, and applying these skills to personal passion projects related to the social impact sphere.

If you'd like to reach out and connect about *anything*, I'd love to hear from you!
