## Profile

Hello, my name is Jack McQueen - welcome to my Github! My educational background is in Chemistry with Drug Discovery, but I fell in love with web development when the penny dropped that it blends creative expression and problem solving incredibly well. My entirely self-taught journey has taken me from grasping the fundamentals to building a live front-end for a commercial cleaning company. Currently, I have been rather enthusiastic about learning about the technologies in the PERN stack, and using these skills in building social impact projects is personally *very* exciting. If you'd like to reach out and connect about *anything*, I'd love to hear from you!
