## Profile

Hi there, my name is Jack McQueen. My educational background is in Chemistry with Drug Discovery, which has fostered my love for the creative problem solving inherent in web development. So began my self-taught journey of grasping and developing the fundamentals. Currently, I am learning the PERN stack and applying these skills to social impact projects. I'm available to chat if you'd like to connect and discuss projects, feedback or questions.
