## Profile

Hi there, my name is Jack McQueen. My educational background is in Chemistry with Drug Discovery, but loved the blend of creative expression and problem solving inherent in web development. So began my self-taught journey of grasping and developing the fundamentals. Currently, I have been rather enthusiastic about learning the PERN stack - I am looking forward to applying these skills to social impact projects.  Please reach out and connect about *anything*!
